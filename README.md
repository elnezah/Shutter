# Shutter
Arduino libraries to use a servo as a physical button presser

Given a Servo.h instance, Shutter library helps you use this servo as a physical button presser. You can setup the position (angle) where the servo actually presses de button, the position where the button is released and how long you want the button to remain pressed before release.

It is also possible to configure a burst of presses. You can define how many times you want the button to be pressed and the wait time between presses.

It ist thought to be used for pressing a physican photocamera shoot button to automate the photo taking.
